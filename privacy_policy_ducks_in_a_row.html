Manas Malla built the 'Ducks In A Row' app as free app. 

'Ducks In A Row' is a Quacky Strategy Game for Younger Players. 
This competitive board game is like a wacky version of checkers. 
Kids will giggle at the colorful beach board and plucky duck characters. 
After deciding whether they want to be the duck that surfs or the one that water skis, the two opponents face off, and try to be the first to line up four ducks in a row. 
Players can move up and down, side to side, and diagonally, but they can't jump themselves or their opponent. 
A fun strategy game, players have to pay attention to their opponent's moves, as well as their own. 
For 2 players, Ages 5 - 7.

This SERVICE is provided by Manas Malla at no cost and is intended for use as is.

The app was coded using Visual Studio, based on the Flutter language and coded with Dart!
