Information Collection and Use 

For a better experience, while using Aham Svastha, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information - Name, Profile Picture, Health History, Profile, Activity and Location. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
Your profile picture is just for recongition and doesnt leave your device and the location, in background and activity data is collected to help you track your activity and update you on the same. 
The app in the background checks for your activity and when activities like walking, running, etc are detected the app starts to look for background location to calculate metrics like distance and speed and intensity of your workout.

The app doesn't use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

When the user connects/logins to the application using any social handle, the data requested would be the users name, his social handle, his profile picture. This data is used to login/connect the user to a new/existing user account on my database hosted by Parse to authenticate and retrive the user's data allowing him to seamlessly experience the app on cross-platform.
Once the user wishes to terminate his account from the application, since the data collected from the authentication from the social handles is just used temporarily connect the data from the social handle, the app automatically logs out the user from the social handle and uses those previously retrived handler data to proccess further and upon account termination, the user data is cleared from the database giving the user supreme control over how his data is used and shared.
The profile picture which is downloaded from the social handler authentication result is collected and stored on the server with full data management options to the user in a transparent manner, for the user's profile on the application.
