<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <i><b>Manas Malla</b></i> built the <b>Be Corona Ready</b> app as free app. This SERVICE is provided by Manas Malla at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>
<p>
<b>Seeing the situation that COVID19 has created around me, made me question myself if I too in this global crisis situation could help as a developer. 
    <br/><br/> Thus, I thought of this app, Be Corona Ready, (Package Name: com.manasmalla.becoronaready), to help in bringing awareness about nCOVID19 to people in a playful and interactive manner, especially for kids. 
    <br/> <br/>There is a section to check the recent COVID19 updates for which I get statistical data from the official government website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).
<br/><br/>The games are based on words (like lockdown, coronavirus, quarantine, diagnosis, etc.) and images designed by myself, quizzes based on preventions, and symptoms given by the World Health Organisation(WHO) based on nCOVID19.
<br/><br/>A small video explaining the app and its usage can be found at the link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zchNwWYGSsE
<br/><br/>Thus, I can confirm that the data which is propagated using the app is authentic and genuine and draws origin from the official government website and WHO.</b></p>
